# LoE
Unofficial Pytorch implementation of Nvidia's "Implicit Neural Representations with Levels-of-Experts" (LoE) submitted to NIPS-2022

The structure of the LoE model is partly inspired by the official implementation of "MINER: Multiscale Implicit Neural Representation" at [MINER](https://github.com/vishwa91/MINER/blob/main/modules/siren.py)
